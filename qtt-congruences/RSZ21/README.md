This directory contains a selection of files from Rouse--Sutherland--Zureick-Brown's (RSZ21) repository which we find useful. 

The file `rzbiamges.txt` contains the list Rouse--Zureick-Brown's labels for the 2-adic images of Galois representations attached to non-CM elliptic curves and is not from RSZ21.

See the documentation at [main/groups](https://github.com/AndrewVSutherland/ell-adic-galois-images/tree/main/groups) in the Rouse--Sutherland--Zureick-Brown repository [*ell-adic-galois-images*](https://github.com/AndrewVSutherland/ell-adic-galois-images.git).
