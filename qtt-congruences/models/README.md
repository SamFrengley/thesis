This directory contains equations and j-maps for modular curves. Files are named as follows:

Given a modular curve with notation in the paper we remove squareroots, sub and superscripts, replace commas with hyphens, and parentheses with underscores. We append with the character d to denote X<sup>+</sup>. For example the equation for the modular curve X<sup>+</sup>(G_11(âˆš-1), ns3) is stored in the file `X_G11_-1_-ns3_d.m`.

For example one may verify that the point (4:-7:1) on X<sup>+</sup>(ns8, ns3) corresponds to E_{48} from Theorem 1.4 as follows:

```
> E48 := EllipticCurve([0,0,1, 468240736152891010, -148374586624464876247316957]);
> j := eval Read("jmaps/jX_ns8-ns3_d.m");
> X := Domain(j);
> P := X![4,-7,1];
> jP := Coordinates(j(P)); 
> jP := jP[1]/jP[2];
> E48_new := MinimalTwist(EllipticCurveWithjInvariant(jP));
> assert IsIsomorphic(E48_new, E48);
```
