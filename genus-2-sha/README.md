This directory contains code related to Chapter 6 of my thesis. Note that this code is effectively legacy and a more up-to-date version can be found at my [sha-7-examples](https://github.com/SamFrengley/sha-7-examples.git) GitHub. The main intrinsic provided is `KleinQuarticTwists`. The `data` directory contains many examples of (conjectural) $7$-torsion in the Tate--Shafarevich group, though many have very large conductor.
